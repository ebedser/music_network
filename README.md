music_network
================

a directed-graph based data structure for organizing music libraries/playlists

Notice
=================
A large refactor is planned including the following changes:
- integrate force and database classes so the node contains all the needed data
- rewrite d3.js code from scratch to improve understanding and readability
- simplify overall structure of the code
- store data in mysql

Planned Features
====================
- gui interface for creating music networks
- spotify intigration
- importing/exporting music networks
- accounts and login

## Need to implement:
- bug fixes (see issues)
- save/reload graph
- undo/redo (stack based?)
- spotify login
- sources vs catagories
- editing nodes via the navbar
- login and accounts
- data tied to accounts
